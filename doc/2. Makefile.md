# Intro
Congratulations on FINALLY getting the cross compilation to work (or just taking the cheap route and building on the pi...)

The Makefile for this project:
- CROSS_COMPILE - set to the target tuple (aarch64-rpi3-linux-gnu-)
- SYSROOT - where the sysroot in use is located

- SRC - all source that needs to be built
- RPI_HOST - the address of the destination pi (only used for deploy)
- RPI_DEST - location all files should go
- TARGET - the target source to compile


# Commands
deploy - copies the required files via scp/rsync to the pi
