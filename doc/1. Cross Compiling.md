As I am a noob at c, I don't have much knowledge for compiling. For that reason I thought it would be a great idea to start off with cross compiling...

To do this, I found crosstool-NG.
I struggled to build the standard crosstool-NG so I found this:
https://github.com/gyohng/crosstool-ng-macos-m1?tab=readme-ov-file

Instructions to install are:
https://crosstool-ng.github.io/docs/install/


Also use:
https://crosstool-ng.github.io/docs/os-setup/#:~:text=This%20section%20describes%20the%20setup%20needed%20by
for macOS


# Configure crosstool-NG

I decided to use a sample start point of: 
- `aarch64-rpi3-linux-gnu`
Because the pi zero 2w is based off the Raspberry Pi 3 hardware, and is currently running a 64-bit OS

To use the sample
- `./ct-ng aarch64-rpi3-linux-gnu`

Set a prefix location (for my build im in the prefixes folder of my image) /Volumes/crosstool-NG/Prefixes



# Build target
Before running, I found an issue in `/Volumes/crosstool-NG/crosstool-ng-1.27.0/.build/aarch64-rpi3-linux-gnu/src/bison/lib/obstack.c`
To fix: 
- From line 328 onwards use:
```
static void __attribute__((noreturn))
print_and_abort (void)
{
  /* Don't change any of these strings.  Yes, it would be possible to add
     the newline to the string and use fputs or so.  But this must not
     happen because the "memory exhausted" message appears in other places
     like this and the translation should be reused instead of creating
     a very similar string which requires a separate translation.  */
#  ifdef _LIBC
  (void) __fxprintf (NULL, "%s\n", _("memory exhausted"));
#  else
  fprintf (stderr, "%s\n", _("memory exhausted"));
#  endif
  exit (obstack_exit_failure);
}

/* The functions allocating more room by calling 'obstack_chunk_alloc'
   jump to the handler pointed to by 'obstack_alloc_failed_handler'.
   This can be set to a user defined function which should either
   abort gracefully or use longjump - but shouldn't return.  This
   variable by default points to the internal function
   'print_and_abort'.  */
void (*obstack_alloc_failed_handler) (void) __attribute__((noreturn)) = print_and_abort;
# endif /* !_OBSTACK_NO_ERROR_HANDLER */
#endif /* !_OBSTACK_ELIDE_CODE */
```

Also faced an issue with binutils, go into menuconfig -> binary utilities -> binutils extra config, and set to --with-system-zlib
and rebuild.
same with: C Compiler â†’ Use system zlib
Finally:
- `./ct-ng build`

And cross-gdb: debug facilities -> gdb -> extra config -> --with-system-zlib 

# Setting up sysroot
In: https://crosstool-ng.github.io/docs/toolchain-usage/
They talk about several options for using the toolchain, I think option 3 to be ideal, so create a sysroot directory, and use rsync to copy the sysroot from the pi to the created dir

I have had issues while constructing a sysroot, so I found the best way to use is to have the pi on Bookworm, which has the correct glibc and gcc, and using the inbuilt sysroot for the toolchain. 
This may break at some point, so to copy the sysroot any:
```
# Copy Pi's runtime libraries (following the guide's approach)
rsync -avz --copy-links petervine@PiClock.local:/lib/ /Volumes/crosstool-NG/Prefixes/sysroot_from_pi/lib/
rsync -avz --copy-links petervine@PiClock.local:/usr/lib/ /Volumes/crosstool-NG/Prefixes/sysroot/usr/lib/
rsync -avz --copy-links petervine@PiClock.local:/usr/include/ /Volumes/crosstool-NG/Prefixes/sysroot/usr/include/
```
Next must populate additional items, so use:
`aarch64-rpi3-linux-gnu-populate -s /Volumes/crosstool-NG/Prefixes/sysroot -d /Volumes/crosstool-NG/Prefixes/populated_sysroot`




# Using the toolchain
To use the toolchain, just make sure the bin folder of the build is in PATH, and run with `aarch64-rpi3-linux-gnu-gcc`
You can use make to build and deploy
