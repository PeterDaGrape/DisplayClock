# General
This program is designed to be able to be extended. Since I wanted OOP like functionality but I'm not using C++, this is a bit of a mess, and was assisted by AI tools.

The only source file currently is main.c, and contains the overall logic, which is nicely simple (I think).
All the views are in lib (may change later), and are placed in DisplayHandler (not a good name).

The EPD lib is for drawing to the E-Paper display, though I had a couple issues with the original, so this is not interchangeable with waveshares original one.
